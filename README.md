# AfyaChain
AfyaChain
AfyaChain is a decentralized healthcare data management system built on blockchain, empowering patients with full control over their medical data. It leverages zkSync for cost-effective, private, and secure transactions, and allows doctors to request access to patient data with patient consent.

Overview
AfyaChain aims to address the challenges of healthcare data management by:

Enabling patients to own and control their medical records.
Allowing healthcare providers to securely request and access patient data with consent.
Storing patient consent and data requests immutably on the blockchain.
Using zkSync to ensure privacy while reducing transaction costs.
Integrating M-Pesa for payments to simplify access to blockchain-based services.
Features
Patient Data Control: Patients control who has access to their medical data, ensuring privacy.
Blockchain-powered: Medical records are encrypted and stored securely, using blockchain to guarantee immutability.
zkSync Transactions: Zero-knowledge proof technology ensures transactions are private, scalable, and cost-efficient.
M-Pesa Integration: Patients and healthcare providers can pay for services via M-Pesa, linking blockchain and traditional payment systems.
Doctor Access Requests: Doctors can request access to patient records with patient consent, using smart contracts for authorization.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy (Database ORM)
Blockchain: zkSync (Layer-2 scaling), Ethereum
Payment Gateway: M-Pesa Daraja API
APIs: ChainSafe for storage of encrypted patient records, Privado.id for age verification
How It Works
Patient Data Upload: Patients upload their medical history and data via the AfyaChain platform. The data is encrypted and stored using ChainSafe.
Tokenization: A token representing the patient’s data is minted on zkSync. This token can be transferred to healthcare providers when access is granted.
Doctor Requests Access: A doctor can request access to a patient’s data by initiating a smart contract, where the patient has to provide consent.
Consent Management: Patients receive access requests and can approve or reject them. Once approved, the doctor receives a token granting access to the patient’s encrypted records.
M-Pesa Payment Integration: Transactions, such as consulting fees, are handled via M-Pesa through zkSync Paymasters, which eliminates the need for holding Ethereum.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
zkSync SDK
SQLAlchemy
M-Pesa Daraja API Access
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/afya-chain.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables for your API keys (M-Pesa, ChainSafe, zkSync):

bash
Copy code
export MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
export MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
export CHAINSYNC_API_URL=your_chainsafe_api_url
export ZKSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY=your_zksync_private_key
Run the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
System Architecture
Frontend: Displays patient data and access requests, integrated with zkSync for blockchain interactions.
Backend: Manages requests, data storage, and interaction with zkSync and ChainSafe for decentralized storage and M-Pesa for payments.
Blockchain: zkSync ensures privacy and scalability by using zero-knowledge proofs to handle transactions.
Usage
Patient Registration
Patients can create an account, log in, and upload their medical history. The data is encrypted and uploaded to ChainSafe, and a token is minted on zkSync representing this data.

Doctor Access Request
Doctors request patient data access via the platform. The patient receives a notification and can approve or deny the request. Upon approval, the doctor is granted access to the encrypted data.

Payment Workflow
Doctors and patients can complete payments for services via M-Pesa, with transactions occurring on zkSync using a Paymaster.

Future Improvements
AI Integration: Implement AI tools to analyze patient health records and provide predictions or health suggestions.
Mobile App: Create a mobile version of AfyaChain to make it easier for patients and doctors to interact with the platform.
Cross-Chain Interoperability: Allow patient data to be transferred across different blockchains, enhancing flexibility and security.
